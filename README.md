## Video 3 - Conditionals and Iterators and Links. Oh my!
Video three provides students with a deeper look at helper expressions in EmberJS. Specifically, we check out `{{each}}`, `{{if}}{{else}}`, and `{{action}}` helpers, As this series continues, we will be making use of these expressions to add more dynamic behavior to our web application.

To help show you how to harness the power of Firebase, Thomas Greco walks viewers through the process of creating a to-do list application that operates in real time.
